Sorted
======

It is my last project for Uni.

It is base on Zomato app that available on the App Store. It provides a comprehensive way to search for restaurant around an area. For me, the UI is very condensed and displays a lot of unnecessary information. 

**Sorted** is a strip down version that provide a simpler UI than the original app and straightforward searching method. The UI is follow the Material Design concept.

#### Notes: What you need to do: is add your own GoogleServiceInfo.plist file, and API key to make the app working.
